### Description

k so i was bored so sue me! neway i made this as a joke for when im on the irc or something i dunno its not perfect, but dont expect ne updates if you want anything diff. do it yourself i think it would be really fun to add this to an irc client , so that as you type it changes it. easily done just change the stuff in the button to text1_change and it should work
